          <h3>About</h3>

          <p>The importance of English in the current generation is unparalleled. While it is indispensable in the urban scenario, English seems to be steadily spreading its roots into the rural areas as well. For a leading developing nation, it is important that the generations to come are well equipped with knowledge of the language, and are capable of facing the everyday challenges of modern society. Fast Forward India aims at strengthening the roots of our nation. ESCAPE is an extension of the same. ESCAPE, English Speaking Course And Personality Enhancement, aims at spreading not just knowledge of the language but also communication skills and overall personality enhancement to those with limited resources.

We also provide required study material and daily practice problems (DPP) in English grammar. The personality enhancement sessions include quizzes, elocutions, debates, public speaking, talent displays like singing, dance and art. We also help students in developing their talents and hobbies through quality guidance from teachers experienced in various fields.
