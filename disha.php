          <h3>About</h3>
          
          <p>What should I choose as a viable career option?
            How do I prepare myself for it? What all subjects do I need to study? What’s the degree I need to acquire? Which is the best college I could enroll into for this? These questions are what a student faces while preparing for further studies and we people, at Disha, tackle and solve, for students in schools of Dhanbad, Jharkhand. These students have a very little knowledge regarding viable career options. We aim to bring down this lack of information by making them aware of the various career fields there are, which are suitable for them and how they can pursue them by providing them the necessary information like about nearby colleges, fee structure, etc. DISHA volunteers organize counseling sessions in schools and make the students aware of the aspects of careers. The volunteers are trained by the experienced volunteers. The volunteers are also benefitted along with the students as they get the opportunity to fulfill their social responsibilities towards the society, along with the enhancement of their skills.</p>

          <div id="section2" >
           <h3>Vision</h3>
           <p>This branch of FFI was started with a vision that DISHA will eradicate, the chimera of misinformation and ignorance, so that no student pays the cost because of such things. As in various cases, parents are not well-informed over the current career options and are often misguided. Also, there are cases where due to financial constraints, higher studies aren’t a priority. DISHA provides the students with a medium through which they can explore their options when they complete their 10+2.
           </p>
           <h3>Future Plans</h3>
           <p>Mass career counselling session to cover a large no. of audience at a single stroke, thereby increasing our reach.</p>
           <ol><li> <p>An internet forum to strengthen connection between volunteers & students.</p></li>
             <li><p>Collaboration with professional counsellors for training volunteers.</p></li>
             <li><p>Disha documentary to spread awareness about importance of apt career choice in life.</p></li>
             <li><p>Launching a career book which would contain important information about every field which would benefit students getting idea of every small aspect of that career field.</p></li></ol>

            <h3>Working</h3> 
            <p>DISHA volunteers organize counseling sessions in schools and make the students aware of the above mentioned aspects of careers. The volunteers are trained by the experienced volunteers. The volunteers are also benefitted along with the students as they get the opportunity to fulfill their social responsibilities towards the society. In DISHA, volunteers are trained to counsel classes from 9 to 12 in various schools. The session starts with a friendly meeting with those students, which help them to create an aura of ease before the start of counselling sessions as we don’t wish that they hesitate to ask anything from us. In the counselling sessions, these students are being told about various career options and also every aspect which helps them either socially or financially. Before the counselling sessions, volunteers are trained by the experienced volunteers so that they can carry out the session smoothly. For this, mock sessions for presenting career options and group discussion sessions are held to make volunteers more comfortable with most of the career options provided. Our volunteers are so much experienced that they get the chance for internships with various other NGOs too.
